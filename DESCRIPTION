Description: Graceful 'ggplot'-based graphics and utility functions for working with generalized additive models (GAMs) fitted using the 'mgcv' package. Provides a reimplementation of the plot() method for GAMs that 'mgcv' provides, as well as 'tidyverse' compatible representations of estimated smooths.
