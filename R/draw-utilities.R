# Utilities involved in draw methods

#' Reorder tensor product terms for nicer plotting
#'
#' If a tensor product smooth of 3 or more terms contains a 2d marginal smooth,
#' we will get nicer output from [smooth_estimates()] and hence a nicer plot
#' from the [draw.smooth_estimates()] method if we reorder the terms of the
#' smooth such that we vary the terms in the 2d marginal first, and any other
#' terms vary more slowly when we generate data to evaluate the smooth at. This
#' results in automatically generated data that focuses on the (or the first if
#' more than one) 2d marginal smooth, with the end result that
#' [smooth_estimates()] shows how that 2d smooth changes with the other terms
#' involved in the smooth.
