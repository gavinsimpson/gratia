  abstract = {Abstract Generalized additive models (GAMs) are a frequently used,
  flexible framework applied to many problems in statistical ecology. They are
  commonly used to incorporate smooth effects into models via splines, including
  spatial components in species distribution models. GAMs are often considered
  to be a purely frequentist framework (‘generalized linear models with wiggly
  bits’), however links between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to these
  models were highlighted early‐on in the literature. From a practical
  perspective, Bayesian thinking underlies many parts of the implementation in
  the popular R package mgcv, so understanding these underpinnings can be
  informative during model building and assessment. This article aims to
  highlight useful links (and differences) between Bayesian and frequentist
  approaches to smoothing, as detailed in the statistical literature, in
  accessible way, with a focus on the mgcv implementation. By harnessing these
  links we can expand the set of modelling tools we have at our disposal, as
  well as our understanding of how existing methods work. Two important topics
  for quantitative ecologists are covered in detail: model term selection and
  uncertainty estimation. Taking Bayesian viewpoints for these problems makes
  them much more tractable in many applied settings. Examples are given using
  data from the NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center's groundfish assessment
  program.},
